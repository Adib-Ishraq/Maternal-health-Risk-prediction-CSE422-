# Maternal-health-Risk-prediction-CSE422-
The project aims to create a predictive model for maternal health risk levels, focusing on accurately classifying pregnant individuals into low, medium, or high-risk categories based on health indicators. This is crucial for early risk identification in maternal healthcare, enabling timely interventions and improved outcomes for both mothers and babies. Early and precise risk identification can help reduce complications and improve overall maternal health. The project uses machine learning classification algorithms to compare their performance on a dataset of maternal health indicators and risk levels, aiming to identify the most effective method for predicting risk and contributing to better preventative care.
